about:
  description: 'The typing module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5,
    but

    many new features have been added to the module since then.

    This means users of older Python versions who are unable to upgrade will not be

    able to take advantage of new types added to the ``typing`` module, such as

    typing.Protocol or typing.TypedDict.


    The typing_extensions module contains both backports of these changes

    as well as experimental types that will eventually be added to the typing

    module, such as Protocol.
